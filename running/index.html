<h1>running 20 minutes (30nov2022)</h1>
<p>haven't ran in a while, I have a "toxic" relationsip with running, i hate it but i love it. this is the first run as a part of preparation for the marrakesh marathon
<br> prior to today's run, I felt nauseous and felt that my heart is weak, after the run i felt that my heart got stronger which is alarming and weird since it's only one run </p>
<h1>running 30 minutes (2dec2022)</h1>
