<h1>running 20 minutes (30nov2022)</h1>
<p>haven't ran in a while, I have a "toxic" relationsip with running, i hate it but i love it. this is the first run as a part of preparation for the marrakesh marathon
<br> prior to today's run, I felt nauseous and felt that my heart is weak, after the run i felt that my heart got stronger which is alarming and weird since it's only one run </p>
<h1>running 30 minutes (2dec2022)</h1>
<p>great run, felt super motivated, god complex almost, almost got mugged, not ready for a 45 minutes or 1 hour run but will try anyways</p>
<h1>running 1 hour (13dec2022)</h1>
<p>hard af but it had to be done</p>
<h1>running 1 hour wed,dec 28</h1>
<p>It was hard as fuck as always, doing it everyday will be super tough and running a semi marathon is very hard, don't judge it until you try it</p>
