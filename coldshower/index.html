<h2>
to build my confidence / self esteem regarding doing though things
        cold showers suck => doing them makes me feel i can handle though things 
        you will experience hard shit in life, way harder than cold showers, how will you fight them if you can't handle a cold shower

<h1>
        3 days 
</h1>
<p>day1: ngl, this shit suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks before and during, but i have done it and i feel so much better in general. I blasted acdc (which should be considered cheating tbh) and done it. it's quiet cold in casa this time of the year especially after sunset.</p>
<p>day2: it always suck but i enjoyed this one, listened to foo fighters on this one gg ez</p>
<p>day3: it sucks before and during, it succccks so fucking much,I dont know how i will do longer periods during the coldest times in one of the coldest places in morocco, but i know i can do it. t feels great to acheive a goal, any goal, however small it is; this time i listened to dr.peacock and armin van burren with lights off at night which felt like i am summoning demons</p>

<h1>

	6days

	</h1>
	<p>day1: it rained for the first time in a long time, it's getting colder every day. doing this during the coldest days will really suck but i enjoy it in a weird way</p>
<p>day2: it is getting harder and harder but i feel like my tolerance for cold is getting higher, i also feel less stressful which might or not be a result of cold showers. less tolerance for bullshit and less procrastination.</p>
<p>day3: I am definitely stoping after these 6 days, todays was the hardest after the very first day. It is so cold outside and inside. a lot of moroccan houses are not effictive against cold, sometimes it feels like it is colder inside than outside. </p>
<p>day4: it was the hardest day, it was super cold and music didn't have the same effect as the days before, it was so cold, i knocked out my silicon tooth out of my mouth twice, the second time it almsot went into the water drain lol</p>
<p>day5: ben guerir is cold as fuck, it was a brief cold shower but i did it anyways, I will definitly stop after this </p>
<p>day 6: didn't do it, no excuses irizwaririz</p>

<h1>6 days (retry 1)</h1>

<p>day1: it was easier than i thought, tbh, it is hotter in casa these days especially in the morning, but i am also a bit depressed which makes me numb to feelings, I do noticed that i am better at controling myself under cold(breathing deeply helps), listened to xxx's 17 album, i also should mention that i haven't slept all night and this cold shower woke me up a bit</p>
<p>day2: didn't do it, no excuses, it was super fucking cold and slept all day anyways. it is what it is, probably will try later. </p>

<h1>4days in a week</h1>
<p>day1 (30nov2022): cold showers these days are super hard because it's super cold nowadays, it feels good fighting the urge not to do it, i am worried that cold showers might make me sick as my brother pointed out, my mom would kill me if she knew, maybe thinking i will get sick is just one of the excuses my mind trying on me. I feel nauseous these days, i don't think it is because of the cold showers tho, i did however feel some stiffness in my lower back that i suspect caused by cold showers or at least getting my lower back exposed to cold when i was sleeping</p>
<p>day2 (2dec2022): super hard, so fucking cold outside, I am probably not doing it after finising this one, ik i say that everytime, I seem to be less lazy. </p>
<p>day3 (4dec2022): not so hard, i mean it is always hard but today was easier, played football after not playing in years, felt super good and nostalgic when i was playing</p>
<p>day4 didn't do it and yesterday was the last day of the 7 days, today was a big day, morocco won vs spain in the world cup and i went out to celebrate, i hade so much fun, i will redo this immediatly </p>
<h1>4days in a week (retry 1)</h1>
<p>day1: (8dec2022): it is hard before doing it , still hard during but easier, sense of fulfillment after.. you get better at managing the doubting and pain </p>
<p>day2: (12Dec2022): when you stop for a few days, it gets harder. but as usual you get used to it and develop mind tricks to help do it, the aftermath is so rewarding</p>
<p>day3 (13dec2022): i ran out of things to write, it's the same as usual, it's hard to get in the shower at first, Use music and mind tricks to actually take the shower => breath => finish => feel sense of accomplishment </p>
<p>day4 (14dec2022): it was super hard because it is super cold but i have done it, into the next </p>
<h1>6  in 6 days or less</h1>
<p>Day1 (28wed dec) the first day is always hard, I haven't done it in a while but the first day of anything in life is hard, the aftermath is so fucking rewarding tho, </p>
