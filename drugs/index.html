<h1>normal cigarettes</h1>
<p>tried smoking a few times, it sucks, you have to get addicted to get the "benefits" which are not worth it at all, smoking is harder than people make it seem to be, if you don't do it correctly you will end up coughing hard and a heavy feeling in your head. why would you smoke cigarettes when you can smoke hash or weed which will give you an actual feeling of relaxation or motivation from the first time you fo it ? i know a couple of people who smoke it when they are stressed which i guess the reason most people do it. score 1/10, the 1 just because it looks cool</p>
<h1>nordaz (i think lol)</h1>
<p>first pill tried, felt super relaxed and calm, no anxiety at all, no depression. which makes sense. i am not 100% sure if it is actually nordaz but it seems like it. it fits the wikipedia description. I get why a lot of people in the hood love it, it numbs the pain. score 8/10</p>
<h1>hash(smoking)</h1>
<p>haven't really tried it properly, seems fun to smoke it occasionally especially if you got the good shit. score 6/10, have to try it properly and more often, minus points if smoked because smoke is unhealthy, score 6/10</p>
<h1>beer</h1>
<p>my favorite so far, cheap, not so unhealthy, gives a feeling similar to nordaz, feelings of relaxation, tries multiple brands, corona seems to be the best one yet, will definitly stock the fridge with it 9/10</p>
<h1>ros√©(mateus)</h1>
<p>first alcohol tried ever, not so potent, taste better than beer, especially if made as a cocktail, a bit expensive, might buy it again to learn to make cocktais, score 7/10</p>
