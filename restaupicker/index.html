<p><h3>Goal:</h3>Make a minimal compass like app that takes you to a random food place</p>
<h3>notes:</h3>
<li>It seems like an easy idea to make but doing a bit of research will show you that it is not as easy as you would think</li>
<li>I decided to make it using react native instead of android studio because it not as resource intensive and i already have used JS and react</li>
<li>step1: Make a tiny demo (simple two pages: 1. has a button saying start and 2. displays a random restaurant near the user from the google api)</li>
