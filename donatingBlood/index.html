<p>Today i donated blood for the first time ever, it was a pleasent experience, I went alone. although we waited for quiet sometime for a doctor to come, it was worth it.the only painful thing was when the nurse put that needle that sucks blood up my vien, maybe she did it unprofessionaly as my friend suggested or maybe it is a painful thing by default, i finished, had some snacks and chilled at a garden near blood fusion place. As most experiences, i went to this experience hoping to extract some sort of lesson or wisodm, and here is what came to my mind: <br>1.this might be unrelated to the experience but i noticed again that i live off the moment, I spend my seconds thinking about the future or the past and not just experience the moment i am at, i am always thinking about the project i have to finish, the thing i have to do, the thing that will evantually happen to a loved one etc.... or just think about the past although i don't think about the past as much as i think about the future <br>2. health is the most valuable thing we have as human, it is easy to take health for granted especially if you are a young male, take care of your health <br> 3. stress is one the major causes of a miserable life, an early death and looking 100 years older than you actually are. </p>
