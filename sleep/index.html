</p>

<p>

</p>
<h1>day4</h1>
<p>
Woke to the alarm.
It was hard waking up
I feel my body still need more sleep
I do feel however that a cup of coffee or a cup of tea or a shower (maybe a cold one) could do the trick of energizing me
I unwillingly took a power nap right after.
I should record happiness levels  throught the day and compare it with when i am sleeping more
Tried to nap at 10am but i overslept again, woke up at 18:46, thinking about giving up on this task. 
</p>
<h1>day 5</h1>
<p>failed, overslept</p>
<h1>day 6</h1>
<p>Failed, woke to the alarm, turned it off and slept another 2hours (thought of stopping this task until further)</p>
<h1>day 7</h1>
<p>I love sleep too much,installed the app alarmy which woke me up. It never stops until you solve some math problem or move out of your bed.
I solved the math problem but i gone back to sleeep right after </p>
<h1>day 8</h1>
<p>
Done ! Woke up to alarmy the app which was helpful, but the maine reason i woke up is because i am both stressed and excited that i will be back at 1337 today. 
Took a power nap after drinking a energy drink, i feel alright. I have not slept in 17 hours by this point and will stay up at least 12 hours
</p>
<h1>CANCELLED on day 9</h1>
<p>I felt like i am just grinding without enough productivity, I will sleep as mush as my body needs so i can be at the top of my game. Understanding concepts is extra hard because i am constantly tired and i got used to it </p>
