<p>takeaways:<br>
-Avoid going home with the goal to study, if you do, do it right away and be serious about it.<br>
-Take learning super slow, fight your impatience and anxiety<br>
-Caring about your colleague's progress is a recipe for disaster, work your hardest everday and ignore other people's progress
