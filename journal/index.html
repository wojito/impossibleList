-Today was a tiring day, I haven't slept the whole night and now I am awake past 24 hours without a single second of sleep.
I picked a dozen of goals to acheive in the next 15 days
I attempted to start cold shower day 1 out of 15 but !i didn't it, I aslo attempted to start run for 1 hour but didn't do it. I got a little upset at myself but 
I reminded myself that failing is part of the process and I will come back to them guns blazing tomorrow.
I also did some programming and succeeded at making 2 programming tasks / programs and done some additional work on the restau app which made me happy as fuck.
I also went and met my best friend adil after not meeting for a few days which was refreshing as fuck, I love him.
I can't wait to complete all those goals in the next 15 days and take on new challenges again.
I can't wait to spend some valuable fun times with my mom and family in general
