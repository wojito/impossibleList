		<p>day1: read a few pages from "The Craftsman by richard sennette"</p>
		<p>day2: read a few lines of the same book as yesterday </p>
		<p>day3: read an article written by chatgpt about life (well written) - and also read the first 17 pages from the book lifespan by david sinclaire, it made me a bit sad but also motivated to fight the problem of aging and made wanna have fun more, fuck what people think, don't grow up, have fun</p>
		<p>day4: completed the first 23 pages of the book lifespan, I am loving it so far, he really seem to believe in ending aging and i do too, maybe not as much as him but i know i will with time and studying the problem and understanding it. I am in love with the idea that we could defeat nature and defeat the problem of aging, just the fact of seeing aging as a solvable problem is exciting</p>
		<p>day5: read an online article and a few different short stories written by chatGPT, I am impressed by chatgpt but there is more room for improvement</p>
		<p>day6: read a few articles written by chatgpt, today was a fun big day, it is the day morocco advanced to the semi finals of the world cup </p>
		<p>day7: read a bit of the book simulation by rizwan virk</p>
		<p>day8: read a few pages of different books, but the one who stood out to me today was a part from jordan b peterson's book called "tell the truth or at least don't lie", he argues that telling the truth no matter how hard it is, always the right thing to do, I liked his story about telling dennis the truth </p>
		<p>read a tiny bit of a book about muchael jordan by roland lazenby, i love the obsession and competitiveness of MJ, I love that he is so dedicated to his craft and is the best at it, this sort of mentality "I do it, i might as well do it the best", a girl who is good at her craft is so attractive to me. I also read a bit of chatGPT's wrtings</p>
		<p>read a few paragraphes written by chatGPT</p>
